Start by running a MetalDock protocol for the compound in your data set.
Create a directory called data_set
Create a directory called compound_1
Copy in this directory the ligand.pdbqt file generated by the MetalDock run, which is present in the output/docking folder, here and name it compound_1.pdbqt
Copy in this directory the protein.pdbqt file generated by the MetalDock run, which is present in the output/docking folder, here and name it protein_1.pdbqt
